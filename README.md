# WebDev-Path
My step by step progress on becoming a web developer.

(09/30/20)
This project is all about "Tweetbook" a FB/Twitter inspired landing page, I will use this project as a training ground to apply my knowledge 
about webdev. I want this site to look professionally and responsive in the future. 

This repository will also show what I learned and achieved in Web Development while I am studying it.
In the future, I want to see how I started and want to keep record of every steps that I take.

Note to myself:
    I hope you will be successful someday and become a good Web Developer, whenever you feel down just go back to this README file and absorb some motivation. I know you can do it!

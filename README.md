# WebDev-Path
My step by step progress on becoming a web developer.

This is repository will show what I learned and achieved in Web Development.
In the future, I want to see how I started and want to keep record of every steps that I take.

Note to myself:
    I hope you will be successful someday and become a good Web Developer, whenever you feel down just go back to this README file and absorb some motivation. I know you can do it!
